Complete design flow for the system:

User fills out a simple one-click form on the frontend UI, providing information such as name, region for deployment, consensus algorithm, and consortium requirements.
The frontend UI sends the user's inputs to the backend Node.js server for processing.
The backend server generates an AWS CloudFormation template on the fly, based on the user's inputs.
The generated CloudFormation template is scanned for vulnerabilities and tested before deployment to ensure the security and reliability of the system.
If the user modifies or changes the configuration of the Eth blockchain requirements, the CloudFormation stack is updated accordingly.
Once the CloudFormation stack is ready, it deploys the required AWS resources, such as Amazon ECS cluster for containerization, AWS QLDB for data storage, AWS VPC for firewall, and so on.
The CloudFormation stack creates the necessary infrastructure and provisions the private blockchain consisting of 5 validators, each running the geth client for the private blockchain node.
The user is notified when the deployment is complete, and the private blockchain is ready for use.

To makes user life simple, below steps would have been automated using simple User form

:the user should have access to the AWS Management Console, an AWS account, and knowledge of how to use CloudFormation. The following steps can be taken to deploy the CloudFormation stack:

Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Select the CloudFormation service from the list of services.
Choose the "Create Stack" option.
Select "Upload a template to Amazon S3" and upload the template file provided with the application.
Provide a stack name, and enter the necessary parameters, including region, consensus algorithm, consortium requirements, and so on.
Select "Create stack" and wait for the stack to be created.
Once the stack has been created, the user can view the outputs of the stack, which includes the EC2 instance IDs of the five validator nodes, the endpoint URL of the private blockchain, and the credentials to access the nodes.
With this one-click deployment solution, users can easily create a private blockchain network consisting of five validators without any technical expertise in blockchain technology. They can use the AWS Management Console and CloudFormation to deploy the solution in a matter of minutes, giving them more time to focus on developing their decentralized applications on the private blockchain network. Additionally, users can choose from a variety of consensus algorithms, consortium requirements, and regions to suit their specific needs. The solution is scalable and can easily be expanded to support more validators and nodes as required.

This frontend application is built using React.js and Node.js and is intended for users with minimal technical proficiency to easily deploy their private blockchain on AWS with just a few clicks.

System Architecture:

    Description: URL of the service.


This template creates an ECS cluster, task definition, and service to deploy the private blockchain network. The TaskDefinition resource defines the Docker container to be used, including the CPU and memory requirements. The Service resource then sets up the ECS service, specifying the desired count of tasks and the VPC configuration.

Additionally, the template includes outputs to provide the URL of the service once it's deployed.

Advantages of this CloudFormation template include:

Easy deployment: With the CloudFormation template, users can easily deploy the private blockchain network on their own AWS account with a few clicks.
Scalability: The ECS service can be scaled up or down based on demand, ensuring that the private blockchain network can handle any level of traffic.
Security: The template includes a VPC configuration and security group setup to ensure that the private blockchain network is secure and isolated from the rest of the user's AWS resources.
Consistency: Since the CloudFormation template defines the infrastructure as code, it provides a consistent way to deploy the private blockchain network across different environments.
Customizability: Users can modify the CloudFormation template to customize the private blockchain network as per their requirements, such as changing the consensus algorithm, the number of validators, etc.

Conclusion:
The Private Blockchain Deployment Frontend simplifies the deployment process of a private blockchain on AWS using AWS CloudFormation. With minimal technical proficiency, users can easily create a private blockchain deployment with just a few clicks. The application is built using React.js and Node.js and leverages the AWS SDK for JavaScript to interact with the AWS CloudFormation service.
